# Spacemacs setup

At the time of this writing (who knows if I will keep this updated),
which is Dec 2018:

I just updated, Emacs from 24.x to 26.1, Spacecmacs from 0.200.10 to 0.200.13
(on master, not develop), updated Spacemacs packages.

Spacemacs 0.200.13@26.1 (spacemacs-base)

- now it should work with Clojure CLI tools, Figwheel.main
